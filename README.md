# Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper is a Ruby on Rails 8 application demonstrating a **custom authentication and access-control system** for organizations with age-based participation rules. It features:

- **Organization-Based Access Control**
  - Email invitation & acceptance
  - Roles: owner, admin, manager, member
  - Membership verification and status
  - Organization-level analytics (seeded for demo)

- **Age-Based Participation Rules**
  - Age verification at registration
  - Content spaces with per-age visibility
  - Full parental consent workflow for minors on signup

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/gatekeeper.git
    cd gatekeeper
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    bundle install
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Configure environment**

    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required variables, especially for SMTP/email delivery.

4. **Set up the database**

    ```bash
    rails db:setup
    # or for reseeding at any time:
    rails db:migrate:reset
    ```

5. **Start the server**

    ```bash
    bin/dev
    ```

    > This runs the Rails server and the Tailwind CSS watcher.

---

## Configuration

- **Email** are set in environment variables or `config/environments/development.rb`.
- **Tailwind CSS** is set up via the default Rails 8 `tailwindcss-rails` integration.
- **Devise mailer URL** is configured for local development.

---

## Database Setup & Seeding

Seeding (`rails db:seed`) creates:

- **Users:**
  - Alice (admin)
  - Bob (member)
  - Charlie (teen)
  - Dana (child)

- **Parental consent scenarios:** pending & approved for Dana
- **Two organizations** with email domains
- **Memberships:** active, invited
- **Three content spaces** with various age ranges
- Some demo content for each space

**Example command:**

```bash
rails db:seed
```

## Models & Relationships

### User

- `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `date_of_birth`, `parental_consent`
- `has_many :memberships`
- `has_many :organizations, through: :memberships`
- `has_many :parental_consents`

### Organization

- `name`, `email_domain`, `owner_id`
- `has_many :memberships`
- `has_many :users, through: :memberships`
- `has_many :content_spaces`
- `belongs_to :owner, class_name: 'User'`

### Membership

- `user_id`, `organization_id`, `role` (owner, admin, manager, member), `status` (invited, active, pending)
- Invitation fields: `invite_email`, `invitation_token`, `invitation_sent_at`

### ContentSpace

- `organization_id`, `name`, `min_age`, `max_age`
- Scopes for filtering by user age

### ParentalConsent

- `user_id`, `guardian_email`, `token`, `sent_at`, `approved`, `approved_at`
- Methods for workflow/approval

## Controllers & Flows

- **Users::RegistrationsController**
  After sign-up, minors are redirected into the parental consent workflow.

- **ParentalConsentsController**
  - `new/create`: Minor user enters guardian email, triggers email
  - `edit/update`: Guardian receives token, can approve directly (no authentication required)

- **MembershipsController**
  - Nested in Organization
  - Actions: `index`, `new`, `create`, `accept`, `destroy`
  - Email invitation flow: admins/managers invite by email, recipient accepts to become a member

- **OrganizationsController**
  - CRUD
  - `analytics` action for reporting (demo)

- **ContentSpacesController**
  - Nested in Organization
  - `index`, `show`, `new`, `create`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`
  - Only spaces appropriate to user age are listed for members/teens/children; admins/managers see all spaces.

---

## Authorization Policies

Policies are defined using Pundit:

- **OrganizationPolicy**
    - **Scope:** only includes orgs where user is an active member.
    - `show?`: any active member.
    - `update?`: admin or manager only.

- **MembershipPolicy**
    - `create?`: admin/manager.
    - `accept?`: user with matching invite email or admin/manager.

- **ParentalConsentPolicy**
    - `new?/create?`: only for a logged-in user who is a minor and lacks consent.
    - `edit?/update?`: accessed by a guardian with a valid token.

- **ContentSpacePolicy**
    - `show?`: user must be a member of the org.
    - `create?/update?/destroy?`: admin or manager only.

---

## Testing & Manual Verification

- Register as adult, teen, and childâ€”verify appropriate flows.
- Test membership invites/acceptance.
- Check parental consent: children are redirected on login until approved.
- Confirm age-based visibility of spaces.
- Admins/managers can manage members, invite, remove, and view analytics.
